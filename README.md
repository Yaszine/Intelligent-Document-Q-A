# Intelligent-Document-Q-A


I build an AI agent that answers questions from company documents (PDFs, policies, contracts, research papers).

Used embedding FAISS to index documents.

Implement RAG to retrieve context before prompting the LLM.

Apply few-shot prompting to teach the agent how to answer concisely and accurately.
